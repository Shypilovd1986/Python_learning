#                               Basics elements of a computer systems
# User interface  - the way how communication is organized between a user and a computer
# System interface - A logical interface that converts a system's input into its output that is displayed on the user
#   interface. A system's input can come from somewhere in the form of the outputs of that other system, e.g. a power
#    button, pressing buttons on the keyboard. System interfaces require physical equipment (such as a CPU, cables,
#   graphics, and memory cards), software and protocols that describe and implement methods for controlling the movement
#   of data and information between systems
# Software architecture - A set of software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and
#   relations. It can be represented graphically through the use of flowcharts that illustrate how the processes work
#   and how each component is related to another one.
# Component - A group of modules that perform related functions. Components can function independently and can be
#   interchanged or placed into new systems.
# Data - Information used and outputted by the system.
# Modules - Parts of one system that perform specific tasks. Each module has its own specific role which precisely
#   defines its purpose. There are hardware and software modules.

# High level languages - is High level is a portable computer programming language that isn't limited by a computer,
#   designed for a specific job, and is easier to understand. It is more like a human language and less like a machine
#   language. The amount of abstractions provided defines the level of a programming language. The first high-level
#   languages were introduced in the 1950s. These include BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN, Java, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python,
#   Ruby, and Visual Basic.
# Low level languages - Low level is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from programming
#   concepts and is very close to writing actual machine instructions. The main two examples of low-level languages are
#   machine learning and assembly language.

# * Machine language: The exact machine language for a program or an action can differ depending on an operating system
#   that dictates how a compiler writes a program or an action into machine language.
#       a collection of binary digits or bits that a computer reads and interprets
#       the only language a computer is capable of understanding
#       directly run on a CPU (central processing unit)
#       not portable
# *     Assembly language (e.g. Apple, Linux, Mips, Intel, etc.):
#   less error-prone
#   there is a one-to-one relationship between what it tells a computer to do, and what a computer does. Replaces 1s
#       and 0s with English instructions. Therefore, coding is easier than using a machine language
#   often one line of an assembly program contains a maximum of one instruction for a computer
# *     Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. Imperative
#   programming focuses on describing how a program operates. An imperative program consists of commands for the
#   computer to perform:
#       object-oriented languages
#       procedural languages
# *     Declarative programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer
#   programs - that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. In other words, it is a
#   language that declares what needs to be done rather than how to do it:
#       logic
#       database query
#       functional

# *  Compiled language (C, C++, Objective-C, Swift, Fortran) is a type of programming language which typically executes
# generating machine code from source code and uses the machine code to run the program.
# *  Interpreted language (Python, Javascript, Lisp, PHP, Perl) is a type of programming language for which most of its
# implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language
# instructions.

# Source code → Compiler → Bytecode (or p-code) → Interpreter → Execution

# An integrated development environment (IDE)
# a computer-assisted software environment (CASE)

# *     Text Editor A text editor is a software that is used to write computer programs. You can use any text editor
# you like. For example, a very convenient editor is Notepad++.
# *     A Compiler . A compiler is a computer program which converts a high-level language into a low-level language
# understood by a machine. In other words, we can say that it converts the source code written in a programming language
# into another computer language which the computer understands.
# *     An Interpreter . An interpreter can be used to execute the programs directly.
